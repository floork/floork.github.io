Hello and welcome to my hompage!

In this article I will show you how I build it and how you can do it to!

Keep in mind, was not my idea it was thanks to [Techno Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q&t=1096s).
We will use the jekyll-theme-chirpy: [Github](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) 

## Before we Beginn

Install Dependencies (`Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `Jekyll`, `Bundle`, `Git`):

for Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install ruby rubygems ruby-devel gcc gcc-c++ rpm-build
```

or for Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -S ruby ruby-rdoc gcc make
```

 then:

```bash
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Step 1

Create a Github Repository with the [Chripy Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate) and if you want to host your site on Github(I recommend it) name it `<GH_USERNAME>.github.io`, where `GH_USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

## Step 2

Clone your Repo and go to the root of it and install the missing dependencies:

```bash
bundle
```

## Step3

##### Running a local server:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll s
```

Or for Docker:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
    -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \
    jekyll serve
```

After a while, navigate to the site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).

Now you can customize your site as you want.

## Hosting

On Github Pages:

### First

Make sure your Repo is set to public

### Second

Commit your edited Repo to Github

### Last

Go to the Settings of your Repository and navigate to Pages, change the Source to `gh-pages` and you are done!

**You can visit your site at `<GH_USERNAME>.github.io`.**
